# TASK: implement the functions 'is_valid', 'sum_of_double_even_places',
#   'get_digit', and 'get_size'.

# HINT: the functions 'sum_of_odd_place' and 'prefix_matched' are
#   already implemented/imported and should be used in your solution.
#   Their behaviour is described in the Quiz A test paper.
