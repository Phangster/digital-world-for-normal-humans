To do that, he wrote a state machine to test his 90 degrees rotation as shown below. The eBot should move forward until it sees a boundary at around 0.5 m and starts rotating. After it rotates for 90 degrees, it should move forward again."

    "#### My friend Julius-C explained to me this awesome trick to share secret messages. He told me it was super secure back in the day. You just shift each letter of your message according to its order in the alphabet, by a super secret constant factor! So for instance when ciphering \"AB\" with key=3, the result is \"DE\". To decrypt, one just shifts back the same number of positions. I realized this was easy to implement in Python with my DW skills. To test my implementation he sent me an encrypted message for me to decrypt. But something went wrong with my code below :("
